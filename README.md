# Student-Clearance
GROUP 1 - Student Clearance Assessment; A new way to check students' status of their clearance progress. This also allows students to request for a different method of getting a clearance if they failed to comply(e.g. duedate). The admins within this space are those who are in position of signing students' clearance as per requirement.
